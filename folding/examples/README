There are two examples provided. One is applied to the user routines instrumented by Extrae itself, and another which is applied to clusters.

For the former example, run:

cd $FOLDING_PREFIX/examples/user-functions
$FOLDING_PREFIX/bin/fold.sh 60000019 444.namd.2400000 1.1


For the latter example, run:

cd $FOLDING_PREFIX/examples/clusters
