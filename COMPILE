[1] Compile libtools 1.0

   You will need the boost libraries ( http://www.boost.org ) installed. If you are using a package system, make sure you have the -dev (or -devel) package installed.

   ./configure --prefix=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/libtools/1.0 --with-boost=/apps/BOOST/1_52_0

   Then just issue:

   make && make install

[2] Compile the folding package

   You will need the previous libtools package, the boost libraries, C++/C/Fortran compilers (which you can set through CXX/CC/FC, respectively) and optionally the clang compiler and the libClustering package. The tool also provides a GUI frontend which runs in top of Python + wxWidgets. For the most complete package, you can configure like:
 
   ./configure --prefix=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/folding/0.991 --with-libtools=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/libtools/1.0 --with-clang=/apps/LLVM/3.3/bin/clang --with-boost=/apps/BOOST/1_52_0 --with-clustering-suite=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/ClusteringSuite/latest --enable-gui
 
   For a more minimalistic installation, you could proceed with the following configure:
 
   ./configure --prefix=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/folding/0.991 --with-libtools=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/libtools/1.0 --with-clang=/apps/LLVM/3.3/bin/clang --with-boost=/apps/BOOST/1_52_0

   In either case, after the configuration just issue:
