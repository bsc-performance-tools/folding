[1] Compile libtools 1.0

    You will need the boost libraries ( http://www.boost.org ) installed. If you are using a package system, make sure you have the -dev (or -devel) package installed.

   ./configure --prefix=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/libtools/1.0 --with-boost=/apps/BOOST/1_52_0

   Then just issue:

   make && make install

[2] Compile the folding package

   You will need the previous libtools package, the boost libraries and optionally the clang compiler 

   ./configure --prefix=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/folding/0.99 --with-libtools=/apps/CEPBATOOLS/libtools/1.0-16072013 --with-clang=/apps/LLVM/3.3/bin/clang --with-boost=/apps/BOOST/1_52_0

   Then just issue:

   make && make install
