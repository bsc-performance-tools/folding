* Apply folding on all tasks, instead of one by one.
  - Feed first instances, nevertheless their task?

* Let -separator in extract to be a string and look it in the pcf?

* Detect that the end of the instance does not have counters!
  Warn at least during extract

* Automatically search in the slopes the performance counters responsible
  for the change in the MIPS rate.

* FIX
  boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<libparaver::UIParaverTrace::error>
  message is printed if the tracefile does not exist when using the -feed-first-occurrence

* NEW:
  Load xml model into interpolate and use the counters indicated there!

* FIX
$FOLDING_HOME/bin/interpolate -counter INSTRUCTION_RETIRED -counter BR_INST_RETIRED -counter PAPI_L2_DCM -use-median -sigma-times 1.5 -max-samples-distance 750 -interpolation R-strucchang 1000 0.1 -source ../source.new -feed-first-occurrence *.extract
Misunderstood parameter: 1000
Misunderstood parameter: 0.1
Insufficient arguments for -feed-first-occurrence parameter
  -> Problem should be R-strucchange ?
