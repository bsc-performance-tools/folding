This examples applies the folding to a clustered trace-file. The trace-file also
includes multiple performance counters from Intel SandyBridge processors which
allows generating additional performance models such as

  * architecture impact,
  * instruction mix, and
  * stall distribution

How to run this example:

${FOLDING_HOME}/bin/folding -model intel-sandybridge nemo.exe.128tasks.chop1.clustered.prv "Cluster ID"
