We provide different examples on how to use the folding and its API.
The clusters and user-functions examples are related on how to use the folding,
more precisely the former is how it is typically used because require little
user intervention.

  - clusters/
    Example of usage of folding to apply to regions detected by the clustering
    tool from the BSC tools package.
    More details within clusters/README

  - user-functions/
    Example of usage of folding to manually instrumented routines (using Extrae
    API).
    More details within user-functions/README

  - folding-writer/
    Example on how to use the folding writer API to generate folding input
